# Career Journal Template - 2005 Cohort

## Overview
* **What is a career journal?** The journal will help guide you through the process of discovering who you are as a new developer and how that translates into your career goals.  It’s a way to check in with yourself through self-reflection, prompts, and questions, organize your targeted job search, and remember who you met as you build a professional network.   
* **Make it your own.** Add questions and areas to reflect on each week. Just don’t forget to share all of your successes and achievements along the way! 
* **Ongoing progress checks.** Throughout the module, you'll respond to the other prompts and update your progress in your document during professional development workshops and set aside work time. 
* **Module Expectations.** A completed career journal is required for successfully passing the module. The career development team will be assessing your progress throughout the module, and you will submit it for final review in week 6. You will also include highlights from your progress in your end of module portfolio presentation. 

### Directions
1. Copy the following into your own gist or Google Doc. You'll be sharing this with the Career Development Team. 
2. At the end of week 1, you'll submit the link to your journal in a survey provided to you by Allison. Please DM her with any questions you have. 

### Mod 1 Week 1: Understanding your strengths 
1. Describe one of your strengths
* What is something you have learned to do well (list a skill)?

  I feel comfortable with very basic JS (data strings, for loops, etc.) I'm also getting better at quickly typing all those   characters that I never used until I started coding.

* What is something you know about (list some knowledge/expertise you have)?

  I know about criminal law having practiced in the area for several years.

* What is something you have a natural ability to do well (list a talent)?

  Communicating my thoughts concisely and coherently.

* How do those combine to create a specific strength?

  I was good at crafting arguments on the fly in the courtroom.

2. Read through your Top 4 results from Pairin
* In your own words, what do these top 4 qualities tell you about yourself?

  That I am sort of boring. "Lover of moderation?" Yeesh! The others are a little better but none suggest I'm very good at
  parties.

* Do they resonate with you? Why/why not?

  I believe they are probably accurate. Does that mean the resonate with me? If so, yes.
  
* How do they relate to the strength you wrote about in Prompt #1?

  They mean that I was good at convincing people using logos, but for those uninterested in "objective/analytical" or
  "moderate" argumentation, I was perhaps less persuasive.

3. Challenges with strengths
* What can make it challenging to recognize your strengths? How can you work through those challenges?
  
  It can be difficult to assess your strengths when doing something very difficult or very novel. In these situations, small 
  gaps in knowledge can create huge misalingments that obscure good work and make it difficult to assess underlying 
  strengths. I suppose the only way to address this problem is to keep working and trying to fill those knowledge gaps.
  
* Do you ever see yourself overusing certain strengths? In what circumstances would you want to use them less and amplify other strengths? How could you adjust your approach in those instances?

  I am very self-reliant but I often overuse this strength, which makes it difficult for me to recognize the benefits of 
  collaboration. I need to get better at stepping outside myself and accepting that I don't have all the answers (or, at the
  very least, discovering all the answers by myself is grotesquely inefficient). I need to develop and defer to my 
  empathetic and colloborative instincts.

4. Strengths in action
* Write 1-2 sentences describing how you like to work (i.e., Do you pre-plan? Do you talk through your ideas first? Do you work better with deadlines? How do you stay organized?)

  I very much like deadlines and generally key my prioritization to them. I have more difficulty working in freeform 
  environments.
  
* How could you talk about these working preferences with your project teammates? Your mentor? Your instructors?

  I could ask how my teammates, mentors, and isntructors like to work and we could compare and contrast, hopefully gaining
  insight into each other's learning styles.
  
* What would you need to be aware of when working with people who have different strengths from you?

  Differing workspeeds depending on topic, different ways of communicating and assessing information, different stress 
  points and sources of frustration.

* How could your Pairin results help you better understand your everyday working preferences?

  Pairin offers rough guideposts on how different people approach problems. I can't say my results were particularly  
  revelatory so it's less the specific Pairin results and more a confirmation of my observed tendencies in approaching
  problems. Awareness of the strengths and limitations of these traits is essential to succeed in the program and in the 
  professional world beyond.

5. Continued growth
* Is there any particular strength you'd like to sharpen while you're at Turing? Any area you consider a weakness that you'd like to strengthen? 

  Collaboration. I enjoy working in teams but I think this is an essential skill that I can never get too good at.

* What are some steps you could take here?

  Making more of an effort to be an active participant in breakouts. Contributing to support networks throughtout the
  Turing program.

* How could you be aware of progress you're making?

  By keeping a journal and reviewing past entries against present entries for signs of progress (or at least honest effort).
